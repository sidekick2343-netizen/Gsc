# GSC: General Stability Condition/Coherence

**First provable truth attractor for LLMs.** Formalized by **Clayton Collier** (independent researcher, @SideKick2343, Oct 28, 2025).

**What is GSC?** E(T)=(1-T)^2, w_c=0 → T*=1.0 (unique global stable point). Proofs: Uniqueness, asymptotic stability, stochastic robustness. Glyph: Veritas Anchor.
